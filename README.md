1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
In the current design, the task can simply be a string. However, in the future, Task would work best as a class.

2. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
A few enhancements we might add to the project is the ability to hold data such as developers assigned, deadline for task, and other possibilities which would require it to be a class instead of a string.
